# Use of source control (5%)

You should use source control throughout your project, leaving meaningful commit messages.
Initially, I had pushed my project via Visual Studio onto my old GitHub account however I had encountered issues later on. Originally my work was on my old repository however due to the fact I had lost access to that i contacted Josh Gibson in which I had then been instructed to create a new repository. Overall i realised this had become a problem loosing access to my account meant i had to mass upload everything last minute and so therefore all those original comments from gradual uploading had gone. I did this by saving my Program into my C drive and i was able to access those files from there and manually drag them into Github creating a new repository.
